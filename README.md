    <p>I'm a software developer, writer, and musician living in Idaho, working anywhere I have wifi.</p>
    <p>The pandemic didn't spark my interest in programming. I quit working in construction <em>two months</em> before the first lockdown. But code school in quarantine jumpstarted my progress and helped me seamlessly find work post-graduation. I began professionally programming in the summer of 2020 a in January 2021, I started working for <a href="https://www.foundryinteractive.com/">Foundry Interactive</a>.</p>
